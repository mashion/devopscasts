title: 2012 Hiatus
date: 09/01/2012

Hello again, everyone. As you may have noticed it's been awhile since I've done any videos. I have a number of big events going on this year, including having a new son that will be taking up my time for awhile. As such I'm hanging my microphone up until sometime around fall 2012.

In the mean time if you or anyone you know is interested in screencasting devops topics, I'd be happy to help out with production and post them here. Feel free to email me at [mat@mashion.net](mailto:mat@mashion.net) if you're interested.

Thanks for watching and see you later this year!
